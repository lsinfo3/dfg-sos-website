Celia Baumhoer is a postdoctoral researcher at DLR's Earth Observation Center (EOC) and a member of the Polar and Mountain Regions Team. 
Fascinated by snow and ice, she uses satellite data and artificial intelligence to research what alters glaciers and snow and what role climate change plays in this process. Her main methodological interests include high-volume Earth observation data processing and the application of deep learning algorithms for cryosphere research. For her work she received several awards such as the Helmholtz Doctoral Prize 2021, the Helmut Rott Award in 2022, and the DLR Science Award 2022. In the SOS project she is involved in the analysis of globally distributed EO data to quantify and predict the impact of climate change on snow cover and snowmelt dynamics.
