I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of WÃ¼rzburg. I wrote my Bachelor's thesis as part of the ROOT project, which deals with real-time monitoring of forest disturbances. In my Master's thesis, entitled 'Blackboard Architecture for Self-Aware Workflow Orchestration and Resource Management', we are developing the first version of the Blackboard Architecture in the SE2 subproject.
