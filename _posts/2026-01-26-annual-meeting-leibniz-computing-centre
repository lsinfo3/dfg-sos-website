For two days, our DFG Research Unit held its annual meeting hosted by the Leibniz Supercomputing Center, LRZ, in Garching near Munich. Members of the computer science chairs of the University of Wuerzburg and LRZ , colleagues of the “Land Surface Dynamics” department of DLR’s Earth Observation Center, and experts of the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior performed a deep-dive on their one-year research. Concepts for innovative and transferable frameworks for serverless scientific computing, including concepts and building blocks to support the extension and integration of existing platforms, were developed and discussed. Research studies on big data Earth Observation processing tailored to these platform concepts and vice versa supply the case studies. Long-time-series-based Earth Observation analyses on land surface dynamics, specifically snow cover, but also other geophysical variables, will help to explain and predict large animal swarm movement pathways, and sustainable processing architectures will enable upscaling and spatial and temporal transfer.
About 30 scientists - including about 8 PhD students – were joined by two high-profile invited international researchers from the University of Chicago in the USA – namely Prof’s Ian Foster and Kyle Chard. You can find more details on our DFG Research Unit, which now runs for one year and is ongoing for another three years, as well as contact details on this website.
