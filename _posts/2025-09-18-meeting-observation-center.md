The growing SOS team met for a two-day work meeting on September 18 and  19 in person at the DLR Earth Observation Center in Oberpfaffenhofen.  Productive discussions created take-home messages for all participants  and helped set priorities for the next steps while clarifying interfaces for subproject interactions.
