Our team member [Nikolas Herbst](https://se.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/software-engineering-group/staff/nikolas-herbst/) was interviewed by the LRZ about the [ROOT Project](https://se.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/root/) and the deployment on the *terrabyte* platform by DLR/LRZ.
See the whole interview about the application of the *terrabyte* HPDA system to monitor the Bavarian forest on the [LRZ News Page](https://www.lrz.de/en/news/detail/terrabyte-research-based-on-satellite-data).
