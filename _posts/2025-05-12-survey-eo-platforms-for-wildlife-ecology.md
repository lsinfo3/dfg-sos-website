This survey is conducted as part of the [EO1](/research/eo1) subproject. In this subproject we work on the detection of causalities between land surface dynamics and animal movement by using satellite-based earth observation data. Through this survey we want to gain better insight in the actual use of earth observation data and earth observation exploitation platforms when connected to wildlife ecology. Thank you for your support and do not hesitate to further share the survey with your contacts.
