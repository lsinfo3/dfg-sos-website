abstract = {Glacier crevasses are fractures in ice that form as a result of tension. Information on the location of crevasses is important for mountaineers and field researchers to plan a safe traverse over a glacier. Today, Alpine glaciers change faster than cartography can keep up with up-to-date manually created maps on crevasse zones. For the first time, this study presents an approach for automated crevasse mapping from high-resolution airborne remote sensing imagery based on a multitask deep neural network. The model was trained and evaluated over seven training and six test areas located in the Oetztal and Stubai Alps. By simultaneously preforming edge detection and segmentation tasks, the multitask model was able to robustly detect glacier crevasses of different shapes within different illumination conditions with a balanced accuracy of 86.2 %. Our approach is applicable to large-scale applications as demonstrated by creating high-resolution crevasse maps for the entire Oetztal and Stubai Alps for the years 2019/2020. Spatial and temporal transferability was proven by creating high-quality crevasse maps for all glaciers surrounding Gro√üglockner, Piz Pal√º, and Ortler. The here presented datasets can be integrated into hiking maps and digital cartography tools to provide mountaineers and field researcher with up-to-date crevasse information but also inform modelers on the distribution of stress within a glacier.}

ABSTRACT = {The extreme conditions of polar and mountain regions foster uniquely adapted wildlife. Given that climate shifts are more extreme in those regions, monitoring animal species is essential for effective conservation measures. Earth observation data offer considerable advantages in areas that are difficult to reach using traditional ground-based methods. This systematic review, based on 145 SCI-journal publications between 2000 and 2024, examines how Earth observation is used in wildlife ecology research in these regions. We give an extensive overview of the Earth observation sensors used, spatial and temporal resolution of studies, studied animal species, methods used, amount of aerial imagery linked to satellite-based Earth observation, and research objectives. Bird (52 studies) and ungulate (38 studies) species are primarily investigated in relation to animal monitoring, distribution and foraging behavior. Products of Landsat (63 studies) and MODIS (52 studies) are used in most reviewed studies, but the potential of freely available, higher spatial and temporal resolution data like Sentinel-2 (seven studies), as well as AI methods are not yet fully utilized. Linking Earth observation data in polar and mountain regions to wildlife ecology research should be facilitated by encouraging interdisciplinary working groups. Two major crises can be tackled at once, climate change and biodiversity loss.},
