        abstract = {Wildlife is highly adapted to its environment. A unique biodiversity exists in mountain regions, because those areas present special challenges for their inhabitants. Due to the acceleration of climate warming, species struggle to adapt. Studying and monitoring animal species occupying highly affected climatic zones is essential for effective conservation measurements. Satellite-based earth observation data (EO) is of high advantage in areas that are difficult to reach. EO data is collected on large-scale at a regularly basis. The Northern Bald Ibis (NBI) is an endangered migratory bird species, breeding in the northern foothills of the Alps and crossing that mountain range during the autumn migration. A twenty years ongoing project (waldrappteam.at) aims to reintroduce that iconic bird species (Fritz et al., 2017; Drenske et al., 2023). The majority of the NBI population is equipped with GPS transmitters to monitor their habitat use and migratory movement behavior, especially in alpine valleys. A species distribution model was applied to proof the foraging area suitability in the northern Alps (Wehner, Huchler and Fritz, 2022). Even the NBI developed strategies to save energy during migration, especially when passing mountain areas, they seem to struggle crossing the Alps more often (Fritz et al., 2024). In an ongoing case study global daily snow cover data is connected to successful and failed crossing of the European Alps by the NBI. This study emphasizes the potentials of EO for wildlife ecology monitoring in mountain regions and suggests improvements of better interdisciplinary work between EO scientists and ecologist. We believe a promotion in interdisciplinary research could also add information to the Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment (GMBA).},
